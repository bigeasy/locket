# Locket Design Diary

Choosing to create a logo-type, my first, with a locket for an O, that can act
alone as logo. The alone logo might take a different form factor, or it might
even look less like a locket, in order to fit into a square for icons.

Not sure what to look for in a font. I'm using Google fonts, putting serif fonts
into [a Google fonts
collection](http://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Caudex|Fenix|Arbutus+Slab|Brawler|Domine|Habibi|Arvo|Average|Playfair+Display|Inder|Lora|Belgrano|Simonetta|Bitter|Monda|Buenard|Muli|EB+Garamond|Numans|Donegal+One|Sacramento|Seaweed+Script|Vollkorn|Vidaloka|Andada|Alegreya).
Then looking at how they fit with the word Locket. (There are some script fonts
in there too, so I can learn not to fear them.)

I assume I'll want an interesting L and k, and a round o and c. I'm going to use
a serif font because serifs mean fancy and all jewelry is fancy, lockets are
jewelry. The font should have serifs because serifs are an adornment, and
jewelry is about adornment.

Although, I'm considering a script font for the tag line, like a note given with
a gift, or a note kept with a locket that is not worn.

Colors, at this point; red and purple come to mind, but they always seem to come
to mind, and white and silver, because that's how I see most lockets displayed,
white and silver, although I'm probably not up for learning how to do silver
just yet.

This is the logo and logo-type. No thoughts yet on how to present the software
itself, except that it doesn't need much in the way of documentation. It is an
implementation of documented API. It needs a sales letter that tells you why
Locket is an advanced implementation the API.

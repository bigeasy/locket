## Funding Rewards

What do you get when we reach certain goals? Well, first off, I can't block out
time to work if the money comes in over the course of a year, so you've got a
month to reach the following goals.

 * $0 ~ A video blog where rage bite one tear-soaked donut after another and go
   on about about what stupid jerks you guys are.
 * Under $1,200 ~ Some folks feel that Locket matters. Thank you! I'll continue
   to work on Locket as time permits.
 * $1,200 ~ Complete a pure-JavaScript implementation of a LevelDB data store,
   adding support for direct to disk binary.
 * $2,400 ~ Delayed-write log structured merge tree, making Locket feature
   complete and on par with LevelDB.
 * $4,800 ~

Funding levels.

 * $25 ~

I don't know, stickers? Maybe. Phone calls? Maybe. A note handmade from letters
cut out of a newspaper revealing the whereabouts of your dog?
